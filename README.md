# Blog Application with Dashboard

This application leverages **Next.js**, a robust React framework, to build server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. The application provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing a blog, including an integrated dashboard.

We have utilized **Tailwind CSS** for **responsive design**, ensuring that the application provides a smooth experience across various screen sizes and devices.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Integrated **Clerk** for user authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly login experience.
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database, with **Mongoose** used for elegant MongoDB object modeling in **Node.js**.
- **Blog Dashboard**: The application includes a fully functional dashboard for managing blog posts.
